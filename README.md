# Dorico drum map for Komplete - Discovery Series - Cuba

## Installation

### Use sample project as a template

Open the ni-komplete-cuba.dorico project, delete all flows, delete players / kits that you don't need and use that as a template. The drawback is that you can't combine multiple templates this way.

### Import percussion kit, map and playback template

**Warning**, this process will remove your current VSTs from your project. That is a Dorico limitation and currently there is no other way to import endpoint configuration and playing techniques, you can read some details [here](https://www.steinberg.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=246&t=194935&p=1029095#p1029095).



You can manually install percussion kit and percussion map, as follows:

1. In Dorico setup, create a new player and click "Import Kit" and import percussion kit you want to use.
2. Go to Play->Playback template,  import and apply "Komplete - Discovery Series - Cuba.dorico_pt"
3. This will create Kontakt VST instrument with Conga Set, Bongos, Timbales and Hand percussion ensamble
